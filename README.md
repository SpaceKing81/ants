This is a simulation of Ants, and while right now its pretty simple. There is just a single immobile queen and no underlying life mechanics

Plans:

Make the many ant types exist, and code the logic for different Ant spawning

Further the pheremones and make them work more seemlessly in the simulation

Better incorporate the different features of Rust to make the simulation smoother, and more efficent

Make the addition of more colonies along with relational interactions (WAR!!)

Make simple barriers and walls, and eventually build up to a full "underground" world, where dirt needs to be cleared out to make tunnels for the colonies
nests

Make the simulation along with controls to make the world infinite in almost all directions, with a surface to place exess dirt cleared

Maybe go full 3D if I become good enough

Make a simple dashboard to interact and alter things in real time without having to alter the code

Overall, I intend to just keep working on this, and keep adding more and more features that make the simulation more realistice, or run much faster. Also, 
I want to improve my skills with Rust and HTML, so I'll also try new things to acomplish that. This is a README.md file, so it's meant to be read. So, to
whomever is reading this right now, just know that I do this Without witness. Without reward. And that there is in fact no purpose to this at all, beyond
my own self-improvment and enjoyment.
Thanks for reading, I hope you enjoy the simulation, whatever stage it might be at.


Stage 1: Basic writing of core features

Stage 2: Implementing the basic visuals
